## 🛩️ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to design a robust, lightweight, and manufacturable **F450 drone frame** suitable for research, prototyping, and competitive robotics applications. The frame was modeled with careful consideration of:

- Load distribution  
- Structural stability  
- Practical drone component mounting  
- Real-world flight stresses  

The project also includes a **structural analysis study** to evaluate stress and deformation under applied loads.
